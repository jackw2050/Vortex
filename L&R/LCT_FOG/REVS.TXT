REV 2.02        2000/12/11

1) CHANGE SIGN INVERSION STATEMENT IN IAD SO THAT THE CORRECT SIGN IS RETURNED 
WHEN A/D IS -10V. IRAW = -IRAW DID NOT WORK WHEN A/D OUTPUT IS -10V. REPLACED 
WITH IRAW = NOT(IRAW). APPEARS TO BE A COMPILER BUG.

2) ADD VERSION NUMBER TO STARTUP MESSAGE SENT ON COM1:

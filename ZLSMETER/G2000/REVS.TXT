REV 2.01         2000/07/05

1) UPDATE DEFAULT VALUES IN INIT FROM GG49 TO GYROPACK

REV 2.02        2000/12/11

1) CHANGE SIGN INVERSION STATEMENT IN IAD SO THAT THE CORRECT SIGN IS RETURNED 
WHEN A/D IS -10V. IRAW = -IRAW DID NOT WORK WHEN A/D OUTPUT IS -10V. REPLACED 
WITH IRAW = NOT(IRAW). APPEARS TO BE A COMPILER BUG.

2) ADD VERSION NUMBER TO STARTUP MESSAGE SENT ON COM1:

REV 2.03        2001/01/05

1) Fix year end roll-over

REV 2.04  2002/07/16

1) Fix time set algorithm. I had forgotten to reset the tick 
counter (I200) to 1 when the pulse is received.

REV 3.50 2002/12/15

1) Move ST control from Host to Embedded Processor
2) Add CMX
3) Increase monitors involving accelerometer outputs by 2.5

REV 3.51 2004/05/15

1) Reverse Stepping Motor Drive for direct drive instead of 1:1 gears
 
REV 3.52   2006/04/26

Reduce motor speed to 355 Hz. This gives motor more starting torque but does 
not alter throughput because MAXSTEP can remain unchanged.

REV 3.53    2008/04/10

1) Fix motor speed to airborne 1:1 gearing
2) Use jumper determine if motor has geared or direct drive coupling.


REV 3.53V (FOR VORTEX)   2011/05/20
1) Change CMOS address from 7C-7F to 4C-4F in STST & GTST
2) Improve Rounding of NSTEPS by adding 0.5 
      NSTEPS = DATA(3)/ST_SCALE + 0.5

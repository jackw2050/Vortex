To assemble my asm.asm with MASM611 use
ML /c asm.asm to produce an obj file
To Link use
LINK fortran asm  where
fortran is the name of the fortran obj file to be linked and
asm is the name assembly file to be linked.
for example:
ML /c asm.asm
LINK tstcmos asm

Running \masm611\bin\NEW-VARS before you start puts a path to ML and LINK at 
the start of the path command so it finds them first.

See TSTCMOS.bat for an example
